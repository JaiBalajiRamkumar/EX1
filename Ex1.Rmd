# Introduction to Git Version Control and GitHub

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to familiarize students with Git version control commands and the GitHub platform. Students will practice creating a Git repository, making changes to an R file, and pushing those changes to a GitHub repository.

## Instructions

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

- Install Git on your local machine if you haven't already.
- Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.

### 2. Create a New Repository

- On GitHub, create a new repository named "R-File-Modification."
- Initialize the repository with a README file.

### 3. Clone the Repository

- Open your terminal or Git Bash.
- Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository to your local machine.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/R-File-Modification.git
 
 ``` 

### 4. Create an R File

- Inside the cloned repository, create a new R script file named "analysis.R."

### 5. Commit Changes

- Use the following commands to add and commit the new R file.

  ```bash
  git add analysis.R
  git commit -m "Initial commit: Added analysis.R"
  ```
### 6. Modify the R File

- Open "analysis.R" and make any modifications you see fit (add comments, variables, functions, etc.).

### 7. Commit Changes Again

- Use the following commands to commit the modifications.
  ```bash
  git add analysis.R
  git commit -m "Modified analysis.R"
  ```
### 8. Push Changes to GitHub

- Push your changes to the GitHub repository.
  
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
### 9. Verify Changes on GitHub

- Visit your GitHub repository online to confirm that the changes are reflected in the remote repository.

### 10. Submission

- Submit the URL of your GitHub repository, demonstrating the commits with the modifications to the "analysis.R" file.
